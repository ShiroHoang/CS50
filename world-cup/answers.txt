Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With a small number of simulations, most of the results are different while the huge number of simulation ussually result in the same.
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: bigger than 1000
